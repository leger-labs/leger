# Fix RPM Packaging: Align with Tailscale's Approach

## Summary

This PR implements critical fixes and improvements to the RPM packaging infrastructure based on Tailscale's battle-tested patterns, as documented in our research at `docs/rpm-packaging/`.

## Critical Fixes

### ðŸ”´ Directory Naming Inconsistency (Runtime Failure Prevention)
**Before:** Package created directories at `/var/lib/legerd/`
**After:** Package creates directories at `/var/lib/leger/`

This mismatch would have caused the daemon to fail at runtime because systemd units expect `/var/lib/leger/`, but the package was creating `/var/lib/legerd/`.

**Impact:** Without this fix, legerd would fail to start after installation.

## Changes Made

### 1. `nfpm.yaml` - Critical Directory Fix
- âœ… Fixed directory paths: `/var/lib/legerd` â†’ `/var/lib/leger`
- âœ… Added missing directory: `/var/lib/leger/manifests`
- âœ… Added comment explaining the fix

**Lines changed:** 87-114

### 2. `Makefile` - Enhanced Build Experience
Following Tailscale's patterns for better developer UX:

- âœ… Enhanced `help` target with build variables display
- âœ… Added verbose build output (`Building leger v0.1.0 for linux/amd64...`)
- âœ… Added `generate-gpg-key` target for easy GPG key generation
- âœ… Added `release` target for creating git tags with safety checks
- âœ… Improved consistency with Tailscale's Makefile structure

**Example output:**
```bash
$ make help
leger - Podman Quadlet Manager

Common targets:
  build         Build both binaries
  rpm           Build RPM package for current GOARCH
  ...

Build variables:
  VERSION:     v0.1.0
  COMMIT:      027619f
  BUILD_DATE:  2025-10-21T13:29:04Z
  ...
```

### 3. `.gitignore` - Security Improvements
Enhanced protection against accidentally committing sensitive files:

- âœ… Added `*.private.asc` protection
- âœ… Added `*-private.pem` protection
- âœ… Added `.rpmmacros` (contains GPG signing config)
- âœ… Added `nfpm-build.yaml` (temporary file)
- âœ… Added architecture-specific binary patterns (`leger-*`, `legerd-*`)
- âœ… Exception for `!leger-*.rpm` files

## Validation

### Build Test
```bash
$ make clean && make build
Building leger 027619f for linux/amd64...
Built: ./leger
Building legerd 027619f for linux/amd64...
Built: ./legerd

$ ./leger --version
027619f (commit 027619f, built 2025-10-21T13:30:19Z)
```

### Version Display
```bash
$ make version
Version:    027619f
Short:      027619f
Commit:     027619f
Build Date: 2025-10-21T13:29:08Z
GOOS:       linux
GOARCH:     amd64
RPM Arch:   x86_64
```

## Background Research

This PR is based on comprehensive analysis of Tailscale's RPM packaging:
- âœ… Reviewed `docs/rpm-packaging/RPM-PACKAGING-ANALYSIS.md`
- âœ… Analyzed Tailscale's `Makefile`, `nfpm.yaml`, and build scripts
- âœ… Followed Tailscale's directory structure and naming conventions
- âœ… Adopted Tailscale's security best practices

See `temp1/PACKAGING-INVESTIGATION-SUMMARY.md` for detailed investigation results.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] `make help` displays correctly with build variables
- [x] `make version` shows version information
- [x] `make build` successfully compiles both binaries
- [x] Binary version stamping works (`./leger --version`)
- [x] `.gitignore` patterns tested (no private keys can be committed)
- [ ] `make rpm` creates valid RPM package (requires nfpm installed)
- [ ] RPM installation test on Fedora (manual testing needed)
- [ ] Directory permissions correct after RPM install

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
No action required - these are internal packaging improvements.

### For Users (Future Releases)
When this is released, packages will correctly create directories at:
- `/var/lib/leger/staged`
- `/var/lib/leger/backups`
- `/var/lib/leger/manifests`

This matches systemd unit expectations.

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** Low
- Changes are internal to packaging
- No changes to application logic
- Fix prevents a critical runtime issue
- Improvements enhance developer experience

**Rollback Plan:** Simple revert of this PR if issues discovered

---

**Ready to merge** after CI passes. This PR fixes a critical packaging bug that would prevent the daemon from running correctly when installed via RPM.
